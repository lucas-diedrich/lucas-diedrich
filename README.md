Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Lucas. 

My interests lay in using computational approaches to better understand cellular biology in the context of diseases and cellular dysfunction. I hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of these questions with open and reproducible data analysis workflows and software. 


🔭 *I am currently* studying biochemistry in Heidelberg (currently located in Boston)

🌱 *I am learning* best practices in scientific software development and deep learning with pyTorch

💬 *Ask me about* data analysis workflows, data visualization


**Languages** 
Python, R, Bash
