Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Lucas. 

My interests lie in using computational approaches to better understand cellular biology in the context of diseases and cellular dysfunction. I hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of these questions with open and reproducible data analysis workflows and software. 


🔭 *I am currently* a grad student in computational biology in the [Mann Lab](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/7698134/people) at the [Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/mann)

🌱 *I am learning* best practices in scientific software development and deep learning with PyTorch

💬 *Ask me about* data analysis workflows, data visualization


**Languages** 
Python, R, Bash
